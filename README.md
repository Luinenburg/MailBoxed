This mod has a simple goal of trying to encourage players to automate by requiring them to produce X amount of resources,
boxing them, and then sending them out. This is very similar to existing questbook mods, but where those tend to be more focused
on progression, where a player builds specific parts of a machine and then is rewarded, this mod looks to have the player
find their own way to automate specific resources and then send them.
